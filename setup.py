Like twisted, spark is a python library and an application runner in once. Some of its features follow here:

 * Robust startup and restart of the program; if it crashes, it's started again.
 * Logging: keeps a rotated logfile for debugging purposes.
 * Pidfile management for making sure your app starts only once.
 * A GUI status window (based on GTK) for monitoring the state of the application and the state of the system (network, power supply, ...). Easy to add your own monitors.
 * Fullscreen graphics display for creating interactive displays, based on the clutter library.
 * Eventing system for broadcasting messages between spark modules.
 * A state machine for guiding the application through different states, with callback functions.
